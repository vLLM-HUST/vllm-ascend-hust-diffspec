## What DiffSpec Does

In long-sequence generation, the cost of each decoding step rises with the
attention span and KV-cache footprint. Successful speculation therefore has
the highest marginal payoff late in generation. However, lightweight draft
models become less accurate as the sequence grows, so conventional uniform
speculation fails most often precisely where it matters most.

**DiffSpec** replaces this acceptance-centric, uniform policy with
**differential speculation** guided by position-specific utility:

1. **Estimate speculative utility** from the current sequence position and
   verifier feedback, capturing both the potential execution benefit and the
   risk of rejection.
2. **Select relevant target KV chunks** using attention-derived signals so the
   lightweight draft model retains semantically important long-range context
   within a bounded working set.
3. **Construct drafts adaptively** by allocating speculative depth and branching
   to high-utility or high-rejection-risk positions instead of expanding every
   position uniformly.
4. **Preserve KV reuse and locality** across decoding steps, reducing the cost
   of the sparse, non-contiguous cache accesses introduced by context selection.
5. **Verify candidates efficiently** while exploiting shared prefixes in the
   adaptive speculative structure.

In this vLLM Ascend implementation, target-guided chunks are scored directly
from paged target KV, combined with a rolling recent window, and rebuilt as a
compact pre-RoPE Eagle3 cache with local positions. The integration is
**non-invasive**: it changes draft construction and speculative scheduling,
while leaving the target model, OpenAI-compatible API, and native verification
semantics intact.

## Key Results

The following **historical, non-Sage-Mate** engineering measurements use
Llama-3.1-8B, a one-layer Eagle3
draft model, BF16, TP1, batch size 1, greedy decoding, and an Ascend 910B2.
Decode TPS excludes time to first token.

They do not qualify Qwen3.8-27B, TP4, graph execution, or the current host
commits and must not be shown as current compatibility evidence.

## Architecture

DiffSpec is organized into four layers:

```text
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  vLLM / vLLM Ascend Adapter Layer    │  ← runtime hooks and config routing
├──────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Adaptive Eagle3 Proposer            │  ← depth policy and verification mode
├──────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Compact Draft KV Layer              │  ← canonical KV and local working KV
├──────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Target-Guided Retrieval Layer       │  ← paged-K scoring and chunk selection
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Target-guided retrieval**: scores 32-token chunks from paged target KV
  without materializing the full attention matrix.
- **Dual-view draft cache**: stores canonical pre-RoPE KV at absolute positions
  and rebuilds a compact cache with local draft RoPE positions.
- **Adaptive verification**: starts long contexts at a shallow depth and
  adjusts depth according to sustained acceptance.

---

## Requirements

- vLLM and vLLM Ascend
- Ascend 910B-series NPU with a working CANN/PyTorch NPU environment
- A target model and a compatible one-layer Eagle3 draft model
- Sage Mate source target: vLLM-HUST `762f85b3` and vLLM-Ascend-HUST
  `4e57439e`
- Qwen3.8-27B dense target, BF16, TP4, PP1, graph execution
- A one-layer Eagle3 checkpoint with the same 248320-token vocabulary and a
  compatible Qwen3.5 target contract
- Prefix caching, async scheduling, quantization, MLA, and M-RoPE disabled

The locally present Qwen3-1.7B and Qwen3-8B Eagle3 drafts have a 151936-token
vocabulary and are rejected. No compatible Qwen3.8/Qwen3.5 Eagle3 draft is
currently available in the test inventory. Source adaptation is therefore
**unverified**: installed, configured, and enabled intent must not be presented
as runtime effective or compatible.


---

## Installation

Install vLLM and vLLM Ascend first, then install DiffSpec into the same Python
environment:

```bash
git clone <repository-url> vllm-diffspec
cd vllm-diffspec
python3 -m pip install -e . --no-deps
```

The plugin auto-registers through the `vllm.general_plugins` entry point. If
your deployment filters plugins with `VLLM_PLUGINS`, include both `diffspec`
and `ascend`.

### Install and manage with vLLM-HUST Extension Manager

DiffSpec also publishes a static `0.2-experimental` extension manifest. The
Manager discovers this metadata without importing PyTorch, vLLM, vLLM Ascend,
or any device code:

```bash
python -m pip install vllm-hust-ext vllm-diffspec
vllm-hust-ext extension validate org.vllm-hust.diffspec
```

Create `diffspec.json` with the complete vLLM speculative configuration. The
model paths remain deployment configuration and are intentionally not embedded
in the package manifest:

```json
{
  "launch_options": {
    "speculative_config": {
      "method": "eagle3",
      "model": "/path/to/eagle3-draft-model",
      "num_speculative_tokens": 5,
      "enforce_eager": false,
      "draft_context_policy": "diffspec",
      "diffspec_verification_mode": "auto",
      "diffspec_chunk_size": 64,
      "diffspec_token_budget": 2048,
      "diffspec_retrieval_interval": 4,
      "diffspec_max_tree_nodes": 50,
      "diffspec_tree_threshold": 0.75,
      "diffspec_adaptive_profile": true,
      "diffspec_long_context_threshold": 49152,
      "diffspec_long_context_depth": 2
    }
  }
}
```

Then validate compatibility, enable the extension, inspect the generated
command, and launch vLLM:

```bash
vllm-hust-ext extension configure org.vllm-hust.diffspec --file diffspec.json
vllm-hust-ext extension check org.vllm-hust.diffspec
vllm-hust-ext extension enable org.vllm-hust.diffspec
vllm-hust-ext run --dry-run -- vllm serve /path/to/target-model \
  --tensor-parallel-size 4
vllm-hust-ext run -- vllm serve /path/to/target-model \
  --tensor-parallel-size 4
```

Disabling affects the next Manager-owned vLLM process; it does not mutate an
already running process:

```bash
vllm-hust-ext extension disable org.vllm-hust.diffspec
vllm-hust-ext extension forget org.vllm-hust.diffspec
python -m pip uninstall vllm-diffspec
```

The current source-admission declaration targets vLLM-HUST
`0.28.1rc1.dev319` and vLLM Ascend `0.25.1rc1`; changing version metadata alone
does not establish compatibility. DiffSpec is a trusted in-process extension:
it patches vLLM configuration, Eagle3, Ascend attention, runner, speculative
metadata, and sampling surfaces and requires device access. The release stays
unverified until a matching Qwen3.8 Eagle3 checkpoint passes the complete TP4
graph runtime and performance matrix.

## Quick Start

```bash
export VLLM_ALLOW_LONG_MAX_MODEL_LEN=1

vllm serve /path/to/target-model \
  --dtype bfloat16 \
  --tensor-parallel-size 4 \
  --max-num-seqs 8 \
  --no-enable-prefix-caching \
  --no-async-scheduling \
  --compilation-config '{"cudagraph_mode":"PIECEWISE","cudagraph_capture_sizes":[1,2,4,8]}' \
  --speculative-config '{
    "method": "eagle3",
    "model": "/path/to/eagle3-draft-model",
    "num_speculative_tokens": 5,
    "enforce_eager": false,
    "draft_context_policy": "diffspec",
    "diffspec_verification_mode": "auto",
    "diffspec_chunk_size": 64,
    "diffspec_token_budget": 2048,
    "diffspec_retrieval_interval": 4,
    "diffspec_max_tree_nodes": 50,
    "diffspec_tree_threshold": 0.75,
    "diffspec_adaptive_profile": true,
    "diffspec_long_context_threshold": 49152,
    "diffspec_long_context_depth": 2
  }'
```

This command is an admission template, not a claim that the currently missing
Qwen3.8-compatible Eagle3 checkpoint exists. It must fail closed at the model
gate until that checkpoint is supplied and the full TP4 graph matrix passes.

## Configuration

The following keys are added to vLLM's `--speculative-config` JSON object:

| Configuration Key | Default | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `draft_context_policy` | `full` | Set to `diffspec` to enable the plugin |
| `diffspec_verification_mode` | `auto` | Verification mode: `auto` |
| `diffspec_chunk_size` | `64` | Tokens per retrieval chunk |
| `diffspec_token_budget` | `2048` | Maximum compact draft context |
| `diffspec_retrieval_interval` | `4` | Initial verifier cycles between retrievals |
| `diffspec_max_tree_nodes` | `50` | Maximum verifier nodes in tree mode |
| `diffspec_tree_threshold` | `0.75` | Candidate-tree probability threshold |
| `diffspec_adaptive_profile` | `true` | Enable online depth/profile adaptation |
| `diffspec_long_context_threshold` | `49152` | Sequence length that activates the shallow depth floor |
| `diffspec_long_context_depth` | `2` | Initial depth at or above the long-context threshold |
